# VictronVEDirectArduino
Lightweight Arduino library to read data using the VE.Direct protocol from Victron Energy devices.

Using Arduino's **Software Serial!**

## What does this Fork do?

- It implements SoftwareSerial
	+ So you can use any Pin you want :)
	+ Defined in the sketch
- Include all relevant options for your MPPT charging controller (see example)
- Include options for Victron Inverters (see example)
- Successfully tested with an Arduino Nano

## Usage:
- Import the Library
- Use an example

## Arduino Wiring

### For Production is a Opto-isolator highly recommended!
### Your Devices can be destroyed! Without isolation.

## Original README contents
Setup:
 - An Arduino(ish) board 
 - A Victron Energy device that sends serial data using the text version of the VE.Direct protocol
 - A 5v to 3.3v serial converter (BMV is 3.3v - don't plug it directly into a 5v Arduino!)
 - Plugged into the Arduino on a serial port (eg Serial1, Serial2, Serial3 etc)
 - See also: https://www.victronenergy.com/live/vedirect_protocol:faq
 - Developed and tested with a BMV-700 battery monitor, should work with any that talk VE.Direct
 - Distributed under an MIT license - see LICENCE.txt

Provides:
 - Read access to VE.Direct statistics and settings
 - Defaults set to read Volts, Power, Current, State of Charge (SOC), Alarm
 - Easily extendible by adding labels for any other stats and settings of interest
 - A diagnostic "full dump" of everything coming from the device
